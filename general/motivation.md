# Motivation

In the era of erupting component-focused development, we often underestimate spacing as a powerful relation distributing tool. Rigid frameworks have taken place of what might have been a simple, implementational vision of spacing, and layout composition that it empowers.

Inspired by [atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design), Atomic layout comes in to bring developers a physical grasp over such previously empirical concepts as spacing and composition. Apart from challenging the interface development process, it also focuses on making it fast and standardized, resulting into **layout that is easy to understand and maintain**.

## Core principles

### Physical composition

Imagine that you can render a composition as a component. It doesn't do anything on its own, but rather acts like a glue that describes elements relation.

```jsx
import { Composition } from 'atomic-layout'

<Composition template="icon text">
  {({ Icon, Text }) => (
    <React.Fragment>
      <Icon>...</Icon>
      <Text>...</Text>
    </React.Fragment>
  )}
</Composition>
```

### Nested composition

Any user interface part is a combination of smaller elements. Since we can wield a composition as a physical component, we can take the principle of components composition and apply it to the spacial composition.

```jsx
import { Composition } from 'atomic-layout'

{/* Defining "Button" as a composition */}
const Button = () => (
  <Composition template="icon text">{...}</Composition>
)

const CardItem = () => (
  <Composition template="actions">
    {({ Actions }) => (
      <React.Fragment>
        <Actions>
          {/* Rendering "Button" as a composite */}
          <Button>Purchase</Button>
        </Actions>
      </React.Fragment>
    )}
  </Composition>
)
```

### Responsive

Having responsive design has become a must in the modern web development. In fact, it is such an essential part of a layout composition that it makes no sense to decouple them. Although its usage is not obligatory, Atomic layout comes with responsive behavior built-in. That negates the need for additional CSS to define conditional layout areas, or responsive css properties.

## Comparison

Ideas encouraged by Atomic layout may be hard to understand at first. However, by comparing it to one of the most popular frameworks for user interfaces you can immediately get the high-level overview of what Atomic layout is about.

### Bootstrap

In Bootstrap you have a grid system that sits on top of your page and serves as a ruler to snap the elements to. Once the amount of grid columns is specified, you start placing some components relatively to those columns.

That kind of grid cannot be applied to each individual component you render, thus forcing you to write additional CSS to implement what appears but a regular composition. This is a primary problem Atomic layout aims to resolve.

### Atomic layout

Now in Atomic layout **anything** **can be a composition and a composite at the same time**. A grid is a composition of rows and columns, and a header is a composition of logo, menu and actions.
