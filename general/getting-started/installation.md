# Installation

## Pre-requisites

Atomic layout requires the following peer dependencies to work. Make sure to have them installed in your project, as they don't come built into library.

* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) \(15.0+\)
* [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) \(3.0+\)

{% hint style="info" %}
Although Atomic layout is a paradigm, the current implementation uses the aforementioned  dependencies. Submit a [Pull request](https://github.com/kettanaito/atomic-layout/pulls) to bring Atomic layout to your favorite framework.
