# Getting started

## Foreword

Starting with a new technology may be challenging. We are working hard to make this process as smooth as possible, letting you enjoy the benefits of Atomic layout in your projects. Our goal is not to make you a pro user of a library, but a professional experienced in engineering layouts in general.

This section alone contains a high-level overview of topics to get started with Atomic layout. Bookmark it and let your journey into the future of web layouts begin.

## Roadmap

### CSS Grid

Worry not, we have prepared a set of useful resources to get you familiar with what CSS Grid is and how to use it. Please, give it a read, as it is a remarkable technology on its own.
